### How to test:

- In terminal, type `docker ps` to find the container ID of airflow webserver.
- Then type in `docker exec -it [container_id of webserver] /bin/bash` to open an interactive terminal of your airflow container.
- Now youâ€™re inside the Docker Container of Airflow, run command: 
  `airflow tasks test [dag_id, like vs-test-dag] [task_id, like task_a] [execution date, like 2021-01-01 (date in past)]`
- When you hit enter, Airflow will run this task and you can see the output in the console 
- Type `exit` to leave terminal when done testing
